# React Currency Converter

This project is to challenge my understanding of the basic concepts of React and a component-based SPA.

### Version 1.0.0

I specifically applied knowledge on:

- State and State management including prop drilling, derived state and lifting up of state in a parent to child component tree structure.
- Form handling
- Render lists of objects from data and conditional rendering
- Using Axios to retrieve API data and render in components
